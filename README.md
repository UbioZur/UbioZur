# ðŸ‘‹ Hey

I am UbioZur, Coder, Gamer, Sport Instructor. I am on a journey to get back into programming and tech in general, So I decided to try to get more involve in open source. This (My personal profile) host my personal public repositories, they are meant to be used by me only while keeping sensitive information out. I am keeping them open source and public as I found it extremly usefull to be able to browse through other users code to inpire or learn. I have tried to document them as best as possible so they can be used as an learning tool for even new coders.

My open sources softwares for public use will be hosted at [UbioZur-Tech](https://github.com/UbioZur-Tech).
